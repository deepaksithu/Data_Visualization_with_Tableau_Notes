# Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Visualization
**3. Motivation for Data Visualization**
- summary statistics like mean and standard deviation can be useful, but can also be misleading if ignoring other aspects of the distribution, such as with Anscombe's Quartet

**7. Univariate Plots**
- for both continuous and discrete univariate quantitative analysis, use **histograms** (alternatives are box and whisker, stem and leaf, and normal quantile plots)
- for univariate categorical data, use **bar charts** (alternatives are pie charts and pareto charts)

**9. Scatter Plots**
- scatter plots can show strength (strong, moderate, or weak) and direction (positive or negative) between two variables
- correlation coefficient (***r***) - the strength and direction of a linear relationship
	- between -1 and 1, the further from zero the strong the relationship
- use Pearson's correlation coefficient for linear relationships
- use Spearman's correlation coefficient for certain other cases

**11. Correlation Coefficients**
- strong correlation - `0.7 <= |r|<= 1.0`
- moderate correlation - `0.3 <= |r|< 0.7`
- weak correlation - `0.0 <= |r|< 0.3`
- can calculate correlation coefficient with two columns in Excel using - `=CORREL(col1, col2)`

**13. Line Plots**
- use line plot for viewing data overtime

**15. What About with More Than Two Variables?**
- comparing two categorical variables, use **clustered bar chart**
- two variables over time, use **lines chart** or **stacked line chart**, or **stacked bar chart by year**

**17. Why Data Dashboards**
- data dashboards allow you to view and interact with multiple visualizations simultaneously

**20. Recap**
- quantitative variables are either discrete or continuous
- categorical variables are either ordinal or nominal

**21. What's Next?**
- **visual encodings** - how we're showing a variable in a plot
