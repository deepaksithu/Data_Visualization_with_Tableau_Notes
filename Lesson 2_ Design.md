# :triangular_ruler: Lesson 2: Design

**2. Lesson Overview**
six lessons for communicating with data:
1. understand the context
2. choose the appropriate visual display
3. eliminate clutter
4. focus attention where you want it
5. think like a designer
6. tell a story

**3. Exploratory vs. Explanatory Analyses**
explanatory visualizations:
- highlight an insight
- are surrounded by a story
- ask a question which is answered by the insight in the visualization

**5. What Makes a Bad Visual**
- misleading
- hides information
- distracts

**6. What Experts Say About Visual Encodings**
- color should be used to draw the eye to highlight on insight, aka only when there is a message in it
- also often misleading to use area changes (like pie charts)

**7. Chart Junk**
- dark or heavy grid lines
- unnecessary text
- pictures surrounding or within graphs
- shading or 3D components
- ornamented chart axes

**8. Data Ink Ratio**
**data-ink ratio** - the amount of ink used to describe data divided by the amount of ink used to describe everything else
- limiting chart junk increases the data-ink ratio
- don't use more than two colors unless there is a specific value being encoded in color

**9. Design Integrity**
**lie factor** - size of effect shown in graphic divided by the size of effect shown in data
- any lie factor not equal to one suggests a misleading graphic

**13. Using Color**
- before adding color, get the visualization to work in black and white
- consider using less intense colors
- use colors that highlight the message

**14. Designing for Color Blindness**
- use blue-orange instead of red-greed

**15. Shape, Size and Other Tools**
- color and shape are best used to describe categorical variables
- marker size is best used for adding a quantitative variable, though size can often be misleading
- can also break visual into multiple parts/graphs to better convey message

**16. General Design Tips**
make good visuals:
- maintain high data-ink ratio and keep it simple
- choose encodings which highlight insights
- maintain data integrity

**18. Tell a Story**
when presenting your data:
- start with a question
- repetition can be good
- highlight the answer
- call the audience to action
